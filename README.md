# Brothers in ARMs' project

[![build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/biarms/wordpress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biarms/wordpress)

This image is actually based on WordPress official image, version 5.4.0.
The only difference was the addition of the 'baskerville' theme (for arm build only): the amd64 version of the image is exactly the same as the official one !

Resulting docker images are pushed on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/biarms/wordpress/).
